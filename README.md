<!--Description-->
# ☀️ Why MijickPopups?
MijickPopups library solves two seemingly contradictory problems - to allow developers to create fully customizable popup views, and to make the process as simple as possible. Here is why we think we have successfully met these objectives:

<p>
    <h3>The power of a single line of code</h3>
    <p>For your convenience and to enhance code clarity, we have consolidated all the key actions into a single line of code.</p>
    <img alt="Code Example 1" src="https://github.com/Mijick/Assets/blob/main/Popups/Code/less-code.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Tailored to your needs. Designed to suit your preferences</h3>
    <p>Developers have various programming styles, and we understand and respect that. Therefore, our framework is engineered in such a way that you can open or close a popup view from anywhere in your code.</p>
    <img alt="Code Example 2" src="https://github.com/Mijick/Assets/blob/main/Popups/Code/interact-anywhere.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Engineered for limitless creativity</h3>
    <p>The framework was developed not to limit your creativity; we give you the freedom to experiment with the appearance of your popups.</p>
    <img alt="Code Example 3" src="https://github.com/Mijick/Assets/blob/main/Popups/Code/customization.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Three in one</h3>
    <p>You can display popups created with our framework in one of three positions on the screen: at the bottom, in the center, or at the top. This allows you to create the most common objects, including popups, popovers, alerts, notifications, and more.</p>

</p>

<p>
    <h3>Multiple popups? No problem!</h3>
    <p>Whether you want to present multiple notifications to the user, or show terms and conditions before they log in, the framework makes it possible - it allows you to keep as many popups on the screen as you want. Inactive popups are stacked in a visually appealing way.</p>

</p>

<p>
    <h3>Past, present and future</h3>
    <p>We decided to reach out to developers who, for various reasons, want to use native sheets and alerts alongside our framework. From now on, this is possible, and in the near future, we will also add the ability to call sheets in a native SwiftUI style, allowing you to integrate our framework into your existing projects as well.</p>

</p>


### There is much more besides:
- The height of the popup adapts to its content, or can be defined by you.
- Popups can be automatically dismissed after a certain period of time.
- Drag gesture can be used to resize the popup, according to the provided indentations.
- Works with multiple windows.
- Supports all Apple platforms: iOS 14.0+ / macOS 12.0+ / tvOS 15.0+ / watchOS 7.0+ / visionOS 1.0+.
- Supports Swift 6.0.
- ... and much more.
